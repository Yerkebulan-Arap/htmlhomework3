            <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
                In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
                From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
                Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
                From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
                A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
                Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
                Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
                The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
                And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
                Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
                Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
                The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
                What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
